            We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.

            <br>
            <p>

            <h3 class="is-size-4">Payment</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase it is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry 
            Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete 
            your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. All direct payment 
            gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a 
            joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.
            PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.

            <h3 class="is-size-4">Third-Party Services</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent 
            necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have 
            their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related 
            transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in 
            which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may be 
            located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to 
            proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may 
            become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
            <br>
            <br>
            As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway 
            located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to 
            disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our store’s website or are 
            redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our 
            website’s Terms of Service.
