            <i>Synthetic fibers:</i>
            <br>
            You are probably safe machine washing 30 degrees (Celsius), 30 minutes with hand-wash detergent. 
            </li>

            <li>
            <i>Silk:</i>
            <br>
            Sponging spots can leave water marks. Once silk has been turned yellow by exposure to bleach, it 
            can not be whitened. It will always be yellow. It is a chemical reaction that can not be undone. 
            </li>

            <li> 
            <i>Cotton:</i>
            <br> 
            May not be colorfast. Probably best not to wash.

            Discoloration is about the same as the cotton, but more prone to wrinkles. Take care when drying.

              Discoloration may occur. Clothes may be discolored dipped in water, and water color changes much.
              </li>
              <li>
              Wrinkles are very hard to get rid of, when washed make sure the cloths are hanged carefully 
              and straight so wrinkles won't appear. Tearing may occur as after many years the cloth may get 
              thinner and may become torn as a result.

              Some items have pre-existing stains (as noted in descriptions) and have been treated by a 
              professional. <b>Do not try to remove these.</b>

              Gently swish the fabric in a tub with 2-3 changes of water. <b>NEVER</b> let fabric sit in water for 
              very long, remove it immediately after washing it.

              <i>Should be O.K.:</i> 
              <br>Wash gently by hand in cold water and light or gentle hand wash soap. If you have hard water 
              adding a tablespoon of borax to the water prior to washing should be safe. <b>NEVER</b> let fabric 
              sit in water for very long, remove it immediately after washing it.

              <i><u>High Risk</u> for most fabrics, but may be O.K. for silks and synthetics:</i>
              <br>
              Use washing machine on 30 degrees (Celsius) on most gentle setting. Fold the fabric into a 
              net or wash bag. Folding prevents excess friction that can damage the fabric. Add detergent. 
              Use a non bleach (chlorine or oxygen) detergent that 'offers' hand-wash mode.

              Gently press water out and lie on towels - <b>Do Not Twist or Wring</b>. Flatten and press to get 
              excess water out. Then air dry, making sure to smooth the surface. Keep out of direct sunlight.

              Tumble dry without heat until a bit moist, then lay flat. Air dry making sure to smooth the

              Use a low heat iron to press it but to avoid making the fabric shiny, put a thin cotton towel or
