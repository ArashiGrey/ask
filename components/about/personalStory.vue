      is from California and currently living in the Netherlands. I love my family, my parents, my older sister and younger brother, sometimes my husband and our two cats.

      I am always puzzling on the hows in making things, and often resulting in breaking things (I've an old laptop and phone just for OS experiments). I can get overly obsessed puzzling. If I say I'm bored then I'm in need of food or a nap. I'm a long-time napper. 1530 or 1600 is sleepy time.
    <h4 class="is-size-3">Never boring ...
    </h4>
      Well almost never. Actually, probably usually boring. I am the worst at storytelling and communication. This is my lifelong struggle :P and everyone else's lifelong bane, to listen to and suffer my stories.
